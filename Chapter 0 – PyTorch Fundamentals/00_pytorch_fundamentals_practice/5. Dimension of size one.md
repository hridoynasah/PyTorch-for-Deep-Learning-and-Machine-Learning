When we refer to dimensions of size 1 in a tensor, we mean that a particular axis or dimension of the tensor has only a single element, i.e., it has a size of 1.

Visually, you can think of a tensor as a multi-dimensional array, where each dimension corresponds to an axis. Let's break it down with examples and visualizations:

### 1. **1D Tensor (Vector)**
A 1D tensor has a single row or column of numbers. It doesn't have any higher-dimensional axes.

#### Example:
```python
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
```
This tensor has the shape `(4,)`, meaning 4 elements in a single dimension (no size 1 dimension).

**Visual representation:**

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]   → A 1D tensor, shape = (4,)
```

### 2. **2D Tensor (Matrix)**
A 2D tensor has rows and columns. You can think of it as a matrix.

#### Example:
```python
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```
This tensor has the shape `(3, 3)`, which means 3 rows and 3 columns (no size 1 dimensions here).

**Visual representation:**

```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]   → A 2D tensor, shape = (3, 3)
```

### 3. **3D Tensor**
A 3D tensor has an additional dimension. It can be thought of as a stack of matrices (a collection of 2D tensors).

#### Example:
```python
x = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
```
This tensor has the shape `(2, 3, 4)`, meaning there are 2 matrices, each of size `(3, 4)`.

**Visual representation:**

```
[[[x, x, x, x],
  [x, x, x, x],
  [x, x, x, x]],

 [[x, x, x, x],
  [x, x, x, x],
  [x, x, x, x]]]   → A 3D tensor, shape = (2, 3, 4)
```

### 4. **Dimensions of Size 1**
Now, if a tensor has a dimension of size 1, it means that particular axis only has 1 element in it. This happens quite often in tensor operations like broadcasting.

#### Example 1: A tensor with shape `(1, 3, 1, 4)`
Let's say we create a tensor with the shape `(1, 3, 1, 4)`.

```python
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 1, 4)
```
This tensor has 4 dimensions, but one of them (the 1st and 3rd dimensions) is of size 1.

**Visual representation:**

```
[[[[x, x, x, x],
   [x, x, x, x],
   [x, x, x, x]]]]   → A tensor with shape (1, 3, 1, 4)
```
Here, the dimensions of size 1 are represented by `1` in the shape `(1, 3, 1, 4)`.

### 5. **Squeeze Operation**
When you apply the `squeeze()` operation, it removes dimensions of size 1, leaving only the meaningful dimensions.

For example, the tensor of shape `(1, 3, 1, 4)` will be squeezed into shape `(3, 4)` after removing the dimensions of size 1.

```python
squeezed_x = x.squeeze()
```

**Visual representation (before and after squeeze):**

Before squeeze:
```
[[[[x, x, x, x],
   [x, x, x, x],
   [x, x, x, x]]]]   → Shape = (1, 3, 1, 4)
```

After squeeze:
```
[[x, x, x, x],
 [x, x, x, x],
 [x, x, x, x]]   → Shape = (3, 4)
```

### Conclusion
- **Size 1 dimensions** are simply dimensions where the tensor has only one element in that axis.
- **Squeeze** removes those unnecessary size 1 dimensions, simplifying the shape of the tensor.
