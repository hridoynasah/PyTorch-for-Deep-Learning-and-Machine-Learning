In PyTorch, `squeeze()` and `unsqueeze()` are operations used to manipulate tensor dimensions. They are commonly used when you need to adjust the shape of a tensor for specific operations. Let's break down both operations with examples:

### 1. **`squeeze()`**
The `squeeze()` function removes all dimensions of size 1 from a tensor. It is useful when you want to remove unnecessary dimensions after certain operations.

#### Syntax:
```python
tensor.squeeze(dim=None)
```
- `dim`: (Optional) If provided, it only squeezes the dimension of size 1 at the specified index. If not provided, it removes all dimensions of size 1.

#### Example 1: Squeeze without specifying a dimension
```python
import torch

# Creating a tensor with a shape of (1, 3, 1, 4)
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 1, 4)
print("Original Tensor Shape:", x.shape)

# Using squeeze to remove dimensions of size 1
squeezed_x = x.squeeze()
print("Squeezed Tensor Shape:", squeezed_x.shape)
```
**Output:**
```
Original Tensor Shape: torch.Size([1, 3, 1, 4])
Squeezed Tensor Shape: torch.Size([3, 4])
```
In this case, the dimensions of size 1 (`1` at the start and end) were removed.

#### Example 2: Squeeze with a specified dimension
```python
# Creating a tensor with a shape of (1, 3, 1, 4)
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 1, 4)
print("Original Tensor Shape:", x.shape)

# Squeeze only the dimension at index 0 (removes size 1 dimension)
squeezed_x = x.squeeze(0)
print("Squeezed Tensor Shape:", squeezed_x.shape)
```
**Output:**
```
Original Tensor Shape: torch.Size([1, 3, 1, 4])
Squeezed Tensor Shape: torch.Size([3, 1, 4])
```
Here, the size 1 dimension at index 0 is removed, but the other dimensions remain.

### 2. **`unsqueeze()`**
The `unsqueeze()` function adds a dimension of size 1 at the specified position. It's useful for aligning tensor shapes when performing operations like broadcasting.

#### Syntax:
```python
tensor.unsqueeze(dim)
```
- `dim`: The index where the new dimension of size 1 will be inserted.

#### Example 1: Unsqueeze to add a dimension
```python
# Creating a tensor with a shape of (3, 4)
x = torch.randn(3, 4)
print("Original Tensor Shape:", x.shape)

# Using unsqueeze to add a new dimension at index 0
unsqueezed_x = x.unsqueeze(0)
print("Unsqueezed Tensor Shape:", unsqueezed_x.shape)
```
**Output:**
```
Original Tensor Shape: torch.Size([3, 4])
Unsqueezed Tensor Shape: torch.Size([1, 3, 4])
```
Here, a new dimension of size 1 was added at the start, making the shape `[1, 3, 4]`.

#### Example 2: Unsqueeze at a different position
```python
# Creating a tensor with a shape of (3, 4)
x = torch.randn(3, 4)
print("Original Tensor Shape:", x.shape)

# Unsqueeze to add a dimension at index 1
unsqueezed_x = x.unsqueeze(1)
print("Unsqueezed Tensor Shape:", unsqueezed_x.shape)
```
**Output:**
```
Original Tensor Shape: torch.Size([3, 4])
Unsqueezed Tensor Shape: torch.Size([3, 1, 4])
```
In this case, the new dimension of size 1 is added at position 1, resulting in the shape `[3, 1, 4]`.

### 3. **Combining `squeeze()` and `unsqueeze()`**
These functions can be combined in some cases to manipulate the shape of tensors for specific operations.

#### Example: Using both `squeeze()` and `unsqueeze()`
```python
# Creating a tensor with a shape of (1, 3, 1, 4)
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 1, 4)
print("Original Tensor Shape:", x.shape)

# First, squeeze out dimensions of size 1
squeezed_x = x.squeeze()
print("Squeezed Tensor Shape:", squeezed_x.shape)

# Unsqueeze the squeezed tensor at a different position
unsqueezed_x = squeezed_x.unsqueeze(0)
print("Unsqueezed Tensor Shape:", unsqueezed_x.shape)
```
**Output:**
```
Original Tensor Shape: torch.Size([1, 3, 1, 4])
Squeezed Tensor Shape: torch.Size([3, 4])
Unsqueezed Tensor Shape: torch.Size([1, 3, 4])
```
Here, the tensor goes through a squeezing operation, removing dimensions of size 1, and then an unsqueeze operation adds a new dimension at the start.

---

### Summary:

- **`squeeze()`**: Removes dimensions of size 1 from a tensor.
- **`unsqueeze()`**: Adds a new dimension of size 1 at the specified position.
